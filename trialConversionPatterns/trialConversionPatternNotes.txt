Going about it a different way: what is the conversion success rate on 2-mo and 6-mo trial members (what is the proportion of conversion success)
#calculate success on 2-mo only (exclude those that rolled over to a 6 mo), 6-mo only, extended trial (signed up for 6 mo after a 2 mo)

-- conversion success on 2 mo ONLY trial members --
-- carve out all trial activity (2 and 6 mo)
